# Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

## Overview:

- metrics and evaluation
    - TER: token error rate
    - BLEU: bilingual evaluation understudy

- best practice today
    - Model Structure
    - Multi-language settings
    - Multi-domain settings
    - Back-translation and Dual-learning
    - Enhancements
        - Augment with Bert [\(see this work at ICLR 2020\)]
        - Augment with Knowledge Graphs
        - Knowledge Distillation
    - Other common tricks
        - Softmax Modalities
        - Beam Search
        - Ensembling Models
        - Dealing with Open Vocabulary situations

## Souis' Current Works
- Souis utilizes a Transformer model for [Zh2Ja and Ja2Zh task, (IWSLT 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.iwslt-1.16/)
